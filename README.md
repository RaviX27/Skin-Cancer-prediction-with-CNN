Skin Cancer Detection Mobile App

ðŸŒž Early Detection, Saving Lives!

Welcome to our Skin Cancer Detection Mobile App repository! This project is dedicated to the early detection of melanoma skin cancer, a deadly disease that claims many lives each year. With the power of artificial intelligence and mobile technology, we aim to make a difference by providing a tool for quick and accurate diagnosis.

How it Works
Our mobile app utilizes cutting-edge technology to analyze images of skin lesions that may be indicative of melanoma. Here's how it works:

Image Upload: Users can upload skin lesion images through the mobile app.
API Integration: The uploaded images are sent to our machine learning model through a robust API.
ML Prediction: Our machine learning model processes the image and predicts the class of melanoma cancer. Currently, the app classifies images into two categories: "benign" and "malignant."
Why It Matters
Melanoma skin cancer is extremely dangerous, but early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. By providing a quick and reliable tool for skin cancer diagnosis, we aim to save lives and contribute to the global fight against cancer.

Dataset
Our machine learning model has been trained on a diverse and comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset at the following link: Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset. This dataset has played a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of our predictions.

Future Updates
In this version of our app, we currently support the classification of skin lesions into "benign" and "malignant" categories due to dataset limitations. We acknowledge the importance of a broader dataset, and we are actively working to include more classes in our future updates. Stay tuned for upcoming improvements!

Let's Make a Difference Together! ðŸŒŸ
Join us in the fight against melanoma skin cancer. Together, we can create a world where early detection is easy, accessible, and saves lives. Thank you for being a part of our mission.

Happy Detecting! ðŸŒ¼
